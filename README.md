# CyberGuard – Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: February 2025_

CyberGuard does **not** collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data — including but not limited to personal information, browsing history, passwords, authentication data, financial information, or downloaded files.

All security analysis (URL checks, password strength tests, file hashing, and phishing detection) is performed locally within the user’s browser. CyberGuard operates entirely client-side by default.
